Rather than on basic concepts of `python` and `pathpy`, the focus of this week's tutorial is on modules that provide mathematical and statistical funcionality that we will need in the following week. To this end, I will introduce basics of the packages `numpy` and `scipy`, which are already included in the Anaconda `python` distribution. If you have not installed Anaconda, make sure to manually install `numpy` and `scipy` via `pip` as follows: \n",
