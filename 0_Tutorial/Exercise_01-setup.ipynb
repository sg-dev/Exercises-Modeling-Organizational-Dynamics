    "# Setting up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The following document explains how you can set up the environment that I have used in the first exercise. This environment consists of `python3` (incl. `jupyter`) and `numpy`, `scipy`, and `pathpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing python 3.X\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the hands-on exercises, you will need a working `python 3.x` environment running on an operating system of your choice. For Windows, MacOS, and Linux users we recommend [Anaconda 5.2](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution, an OpenSource `python` 3 distribution that comes pre-configured for data science and machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up `jupyter`, `numpy`, and `scipy`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have installed Anaconda in the previous step, you can skip over this section, as the packages `jupyter`, `numpy`, and `scipy` come preinstalled with the Anaconda distribution. However, if you start from a barebone `python 3.x` installation, you will need to manually install these three additional packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simply run the following commands in a terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install jupyter\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "pip install scipy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the installation has finished, you should be able to start a `jupyter` notebook server, which allows you to open and edit `jupyter` notebooks in your browser. Just run the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will fire up a web browser in which you see your local filesystem. Simply navigate to the `ipynb` notebook that you want to open, or create a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up networkx\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install networkx`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Verifying your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have installed all necessary tools and packages, let us verify that our environment is set up properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, simply create a new file in Visual Studio Code and copy the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#%%\n",
    "import networkx as nx\n",
    "\n",
    "G = nx.DiGraph()\n",
    "G.add_edge('a', 'b')\n",
    "\n",
    "#%%\n",
    "# Display a summary of the graph\n",
    "G.number_of_edges()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `python` extension of Visual Studio Code has been installed properly, you should see the `python` code properly highlighted and colored. If the `jupyter` extension has been set up correctly, two code lenses `Run cell` will appear above the `#%%` tags. These tags mark the start of a cell in a `jupyter` notebook that we can execute directly fron within Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the top-most `Run cell` code lens. A menu will appear, asking you whether to start a new notebook or whether to select an existing `jupyter` notebook server. Select `Start a new Notebook` and wait for the status line `Python 3 Kernel (idle)` to appear in Visual Studio Code's status bar. Now click the second `Run cell` code lens. A new window should pop up that shows a network visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see this network, all is working properly, and you are all set to work on the exercises of our course. I would recommend to start with the tutorial provided on moodle."
