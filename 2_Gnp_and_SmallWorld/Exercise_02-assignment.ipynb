    "In this week's assignment, we explore some of the models for random graphs and small-world networks that we have introduced. We specifically study how diameter, clustering coefficient, and degree distribution of random graphs are related to the parameters of the $G(n,p)$ model. We further implement the Watts-Strogatz model and explore how its parameters influence those characteristics that are associated with the small-world property of complex networks."
